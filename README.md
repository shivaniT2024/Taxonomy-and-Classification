# Taxonomy-and-Classification

This project uses an autoencoder to generate embeddings of image and text data. Firstly, I cleaned the data by combining certain columns to create a single engagement score, and also employed one-hot encoding and normalization. After generating the embeddings, I used K-NN to generate 10 classes and categorize the data accordingly. I used PCA analysis to visualise the clusters created by K-NN.
